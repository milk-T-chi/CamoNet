This repository provides the official TensorFlow implementation of the paper:

"CamoNet: On-Device Neural Network Adaptation With Zero Interaction and Unlabeled Data for Diverse Edge Environments"
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522944

The project includes the on-device training and evaluation pipeline reported in the paper.

The datasets and pretrained model weights (.h5 files) used in this project are not included in this repository due to licensing and file size restrictions.

Users are required to download the necessary datasets and pretrained weights from the official Keras website:

Official Keras website: https://keras.io/

Please ensure that:

The downloaded datasets correspond to the versions specified in the paper.

The pretrained .h5 weight files are compatible with the TensorFlow/Keras version used in this repository.

All downloaded files are placed in the appropriate directory as described in the code.
